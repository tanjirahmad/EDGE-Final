### What I have used local storage for managing Data 

I used local storage to manage data. At first I checked that id I want to add to local storage. If this id already exist I will get that id otherwise I get an empty array. Then checked which id I got and which id I want to add are they same or not. I they match it will give me an alert "Product already exist", if they do not match the id will be added to the local storage.
